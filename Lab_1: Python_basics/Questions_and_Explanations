Q1
A)

B)
Define Constants G and Ms
Define Initial Conditions: x, y, Vx, and Vy
Convert Units of Initial conditions to Si
Initialize end_time and dt
Convert Units of time
While t is smaller than t_end
    Increment x, y, Vx, and Vy with their previous values using Euler-Cromer. Compute Vx and Vy first for Euler-Cromer
Plot Velocity vs Time graph
Plot x vx y graph


Q2
A) What to Submit: Pseudocode, Code, and Plot showing both Earth's and Jupiter's orbits
Pseudocode:
Define constants Ms, G, Mj, and the conversion of 1 AU to meters
Define initial conditions, i.e., the coordinates and velocities for both Earth and Jupiter
Initialize current_time, end_time, and dt
While current_time is less than end_time
    Increment the locations (xj and yj) and velocities (Vxj and Vyj) of Jupiter using Euler-Cromer
    Store the new coordinates of Jupiter
    Calculate the distance between the Earth and Jupiter's new location
    Increment the locations (xe and ye) and velocities (Vxe and Vye) of Earth using Euler-Cromer
    Store the new coordinates of the Earth
    Increment current_time by dt
Plot both Earth's and Jupiter's orbits
